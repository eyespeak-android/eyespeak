## Camera to Voice Application (Optic)

### Pages

The Android application for using OCR to translate text from a camera and read it out to the user is composed of six main pages:

1. Home Page: provides information about the application's purpose and features.
2. Camera Page: allows the user to take pictures of text that they want to translate. Include the ability to translate languages.
3. (Maybe)Settings Page: allows the user to adjust various settings for the application.
4. Help/FAQ Page: provides information on how to use the application and answers to frequently asked questions.


### Features

The Android application has two main features:

1. Translating text from the camera cross-languages: the application uses OCR to capture text from a camera and translate it into the language selected by the user.
2. Giving voice commands end-to-end: the application reads out the translated text using a voice selected by the user.

Overall, the Android application provides a convenient and user-friendly way to translate text from a camera and have it read out to the user using OCR technology.
